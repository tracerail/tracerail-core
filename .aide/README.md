# AI Development Environment (AIDE) Manual

This directory contains a set of markdown files designed to provide context to an AI development assistant working on the Tracerail platform. These documents serve as a "project briefing" to enable a faster, more accurate, and more efficient development workflow.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this manual is to solve the "cold start" problem inherent in conversational AI development. By providing a stable, version-controlled source of truth for the project's architecture, goals, and key workflows, we can significantly reduce the time the AI needs for discovery and minimize errors caused by a misunderstanding of the project's structure.

## Core Documents

This manual is composed of the following key documents:

*   **`project-overview.md`**: A high-level summary of each repository in the Tracerail platform, describing its purpose and primary technology.
*   **`architecture.md`**: A summary of our key architectural principles and decisions, with links to the detailed Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
*   **`development-workflow.md`**: A cheat sheet of the essential commands for testing and running the applications, such as running contract tests or starting a local server.

## How to Use

Before beginning a new development session, the AI agent should be instructed to read the files in this directory to establish its context. This will ensure its work is aligned with the project's established standards and architecture.
